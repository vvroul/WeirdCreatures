H...hi.

Hello, friend!

Uhm, is this the right world or am I trapped in here?

Depends on where you were going my friend.


* [Light world]
  
  Oh, my friend then you have to go this way.
  
  And go down that way. 
  
  And turn left at this route. 
  
  And...
  
  ** Is it really that far away?
  
  ** Ok I'm out of here.

* [Shadow world]

  Well then yes, of course it's the right one! 
  
  Tell me now, did you have a long trip to here?
